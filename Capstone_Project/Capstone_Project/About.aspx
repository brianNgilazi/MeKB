    <h3>Mentorship Knowledge Base (MeKB)</h3>
    <p>The Computer Science department, along with the rest of the university community, is trying to create a more inclusive environment. One of the primary strategies in doing that is a mentorship programme, where senior students meet with first year students on a regular basis. One of the problems is that many students for whatever reason don’t actively participate in the programme, i.e. meet with mentors; and also the students who do participate may have questions and may not want to have to wait for a mentorship meeting to get them answered. So it would be useful if there was a searchable web-based mentorship knowledgebase, which students could browse through or query, which could present them with relevant information to their queries, or forward their query to a “virtual” mentor if their query could not be answered in an automated way. The knowledgebase would contain a list of old queries and answers, references to local resource websites (e.g. www.careers.uct.ac.za) and useful external resources (e.g. www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/videos/index.html). The system should also allow students to rate resources and to indicate how useful they are.</p>
